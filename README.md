This is a more complicated project from The Odin Project that challenged DOM Manipulation knowledge and skills.

What I learned:
1. Generating multiple elements in the DOM
2. Adding the same event listener to each of those elements
3. Using CSS Grid to have children always occupy space equal to the parent's pixels

DISCLAIMER: 
The design and styling has not been fully established as of now, as I focused on figuring out the functionality first. However, I will fully establish the overall design once I finish the last project on The Odin Project.

Right now I am working on: The Calculator Project.
